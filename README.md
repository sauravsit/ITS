# Intelligent Test Selection (ITS)

This tutorial provides the user a step-by-step explanation on how to use Intelligent Test Selection (ITS) for RTL regression.  An open source lowRISC/ibex design and RISC-V DV testbench (https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex) has been chosen for this tutorial. 

## Data Source 
Opensource Design: lowRISC/ibex design and RISC-V DV testbench (https://github.com/lowRISC/ibex)

## Prerequisites
- Git access required (version 1.7.1 or newer)
To get latest version
```
ADD "git" to your $PATH
```

- VCS-MX 2019.06 or newer version
To get latest version of VCS-MX (Synopsys VCS Compiler)
```
ADD "vcs" to your $PATH
```

- The user is expected to get a docker enabled machine/VM with sudo access. 
It should be a machine with following minimum requirements.

Resource | Values
---------|-------
CPU |	4
Memory |	32-64GB
Storage |	~200GB

## ITS Installation
- ITS software is not opensource at the moment (TBD).

## Checkout Commits
### Commit List
- The user can find the list of commits in consideration from given file: rtl_commits

- This file has 72 commit hashes spanned across 39 days from oldest to newest from ibex git history (git command: git log –pretty=fuller) from which we have picked the recent ones that have RTL changes and run successfully to completion. 

- The user can find corresponding timestamp of each commit from commit_date.json file provided.

### Checkout a Commit
- The process of retrieving a commit from git repository. The user should follow following commands.
```
git reset --hard
git checkout <commit_hash>
```

## Run Ibex
This section explains how to compile ibex design and how to run regression of ibex design.

Ibex run consists of 6 make targets (gen gcc_compile iss_sim compile rtl_sim post_compare) in two major phases to run its full regression.
1.	Compilation (This will generate tests in addition to compilation)
2.	Run tests

All these commands should be executed from <work directory>/ibex/dv/uvm directory.

### Compilation 
The user is required to do the following for compilation step (Please refer to Makefile for other variables) 
- ITERATIONS - Number of iterations for each test, assign a non-zero value to override the iteration count in the test list. For fast turnaround, specify it to 1.
- ISS - Select the instruction set simulator, either spike or ovpsim (suggest using ovpsim)
- COV - Enable coverage dump, 1 enabled, 0 disabled, ,by default disabled
- WAVES - Enable waveform dumping, 1 enabled, 0 disabled, by default enabled.

```
make clean gen gcc_compile iss_sim compile ITERATIONS=1 ISS=ovpsim COV=1 WAVES=0

```

This step shall take less than 3 mins. Generated files will be located inside ‘out’ directory.
ITS will require vdb directory (test.vdb/) which is generated inside ‘out/rtl_sim’

### Run tests
In this phase, the user will run all the testcases.

```
make rtl_sim  post_compare ITERATIONS=1 COV=1 ISS=ovpsim WAVES=0

```

This step shall take ~10 mins. If ITERATION=1 is not specified. It could take more than 30 mins. There will be a separate run directory for each test under out/rtl_sim/<test_name>/. Coverage will be stored under out/rtl_sim/test.vdb when coverage is turned on. Compile-time vdb and run-time vdb could be the same or different controlled by option -cm_dir.

*Notes:* For any testbench environment that has over 10,000 tests per simulation (simv), we recommend having one vdb per test instead of having one vdb for all tests using -cm_name for merging performance reason.

In this phase a regr.log file is created inside ‘out/’ directory if this phase finishes successfully. This file is required for ITS.

## ITS Installation
- ITS software is not opensource at the moment (TBD).
- Run ITS software to generate predictions.

## Experimental Results

- Indidividual predictions generated by ITS for each Git Hash after training the model.
